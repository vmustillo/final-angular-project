# FinalProjectAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.5.

## Dependencies
+ make sure angular CLI has been installed globally
```
ng -v
npm list -g ng
```

## Requirements
+ create project final-project-angular using angular CLI
+ create below directories
```
src/app/components
src/app/services
```
+ create component; teacherList  in above components directory
+ create service; teacherListData in above services directory
+ in TeacherListDataService export Teacher interface of;
```
  teacherId: string,
  name:string,
  lastname: string,
  title: string,
  age: number,
  isFullTime: boolean,
  updatedOn: Date   
```
+ let TeacherListDataService have a getTeachers() method that invokes 'http://localhost:9016/api/v1/teachers' REST GET service, and returns what is returned from that REST service as an observable in json
+ let TeacherListDataService be injected to TeacherListComponent's constructor
+ let TeacherListComponent have an attribute 'teachers' of type Teacher[]
+ let TeacherListComponent's ngOnInit() method invoke TeacherListDataService's getTeachers method to initialize this.teachers
+ let TeacherListComponent have an attribute isToDisplayTeachers of type boolean initialized to false
+ let TeacherListComponent have toggleToDisplayTeachers() method that toggles the isToDisplayTeachers value
+ let templateUrl (html) of TeacherListComponent have a button, which will execute toggleToDisplayTeachers() function when clicked
+ let templateUrl (html) of TeacherListComponent have div that will be displayed when isToDisplayTeachers is true
+ let above div have a <h3>Teachers</h3> and another inner div
+ let above inner div loop over the 'teachers' and for each create <ul>, which have <li> element for these selected attributes (teacherId, name, lastname, title, age, isFullTime) of Teacher interface. 
+ let templateUrl (html) of AppComponent use above created teacherList component's selector, <app-teacher-list>
+ hence, in summary the angular app running at default port 4200, will initially display a button, which will unhide/hide list of teachers that are fetched from mongodb via final_project_rest app serving REST services at port 9016.
+ see the 2 screen shots of UI from ilker's email

## submission details
+ capture screen shot of angular app running, initially. Then screen shot another after button is clicked displaying list of teachers fetched from mongodb. Send these screen captures along with github link upon submission
+ Create a github repo final-project-angular and commit it on the day and time that will be emailed by ilker
+ Email the link to github and screen captures to ilkerkiris@gmail.com
